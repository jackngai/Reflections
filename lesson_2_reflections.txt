What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a empty repository by creating a .git folder in the folder that you ran "git init" in. You need to do this to tell Git that you want to create a repository for this folder. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area let you determine which file you want to add to commit instead of forcing you to commit all the files in the working directory.
