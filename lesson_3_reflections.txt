When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Couple of situations: 1. The computer I'm working from isn't mine. 2. I switch between multiple computers and need to keep them all up-to-date. 3. I'm collaborating with someone on the code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If your remote is public, others might be contributing code that you don't want to pull down. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are use to copy someone else's code so you can make modifications. Clones are use for editing a repository's files locally. Branches are different version of the repository that you are working on. While you can technically fork your own code, it is faster to just create a branch.
